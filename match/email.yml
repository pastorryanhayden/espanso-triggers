      Hi [Name],

      Thanks for reaching out! To ensure your request is properly tracked and prioritized, please create a ticket here: https://ruralking.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4

      Most requests are resolved by the end of the next sprint (typically less than a week), and urgent items are often handled same day.

      I'll follow up once we've started working on it.

      Thanks!
