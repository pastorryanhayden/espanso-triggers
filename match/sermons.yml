      I'm preaching this week on [[passage]]. 
      1. I like to start by making a paraphrase from the KJV and make sure that my understanding of the text is correct.
      2. Then I read about a half dozen commentaries and take notes.
      3. I decide what the thrust of my message is going to be and try to write it in one clear sentence.
      4. From all of that I try to write an outline.
      5. I decide on an angle to approach the manuscript and come up with an introduction.
      6. I write the manuscript, aiming to write 3,500 words or so (including the text.)
      I'm interested in feedback, but not feedback on pacing. I'll be sharing with you what I have, and using you as a writing and research partner through the process. Please be direct and honest in your feedback - I value constructive criticism over excessive praise.
